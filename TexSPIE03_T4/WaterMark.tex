    In this paper presented a laser servoing system for precision motion control.

This paper carefully analyzed all requirements on the laser servoing system from those constrains, then proposed Hough transform based algorithms as the feedback processor. SHT and SPHT were implemented as the kernel algorithms for the bumper fitter. For this application, SHT is faster but takes more memory, and SPHT is vice versa: takes less memory but slower.
